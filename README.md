# Pokedex (Vue)

# What is the Pokedex?
For anyone who has played Pokemon, the Pokedex was a digital encyclopedia that stored all of the information of all Pokemon in a database.

I am using the following:
- Vue.js
- Axios

I am also creating a "wrapper" library in order to create a broad array of functions that will be used in order to retrieve information such as Pokemon info, berry info, etc.

# To Do List
* Create responsive layout
* Link data from API to layout
* Create interface where Pokemon can be categorized based on Generation.
* Create interface where users to see various other API endpoints such as TM's, HM's, berries, etc.

# Motivation
Still learning Vue.js, so I am making as many projects as I can.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```
